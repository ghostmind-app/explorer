# Project Vision: Map Your City

This project, **Map Your City**, aims to create an innovative platform that transforms how users explore and interact with the world. The core idea is to empower users to build a personalized mapping experience.

## Guiding Principles:

*   **Personalization**: Allow users to save personal checkpoints (landmarks or unique spots) with custom names.
*   **Journey Creation**: Enable users to design and share routes by connecting checkpoints, facilitating tailored adventures.
*   **Curated Collections**: Support grouping checkpoints into themed collections (e.g., "Best Coffee Shops") for easy discovery and sharing.
*   **Community & Sharing**: Foster a community by allowing users to share checkpoints, routes, and collections, and discover content from others.
*   **Discovery**: Help users uncover hidden gems and move beyond generic maps.
*   **Ease of Use**: Ensure a user-friendly interface for effortless mapping and sharing.

The overall goal is to redefine interaction with surroundings, making the world discoverable "one checkpoint at a time," as detailed in [Readme.md](mdc:Readme.md).
